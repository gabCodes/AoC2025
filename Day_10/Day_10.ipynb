    "`[.##.] (3) (1,3) (2) (2,3) (0,2) (0,1) {3,5,4,7}` (Notice that since in part 1 we don't need the voltages, we can safely ignore them) \n",
    "\n",
    "This essentially asks, starting from zero '....' what's the minimum amount of buttons we need to press to get to the target '.##.'?\n",
    "To solve this, we will use the intuition from the question that discussed how the work as booleans through the XOR operation `^` as pressing the same button twice causes us to go back to where we started.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target can be rephrased as a binary number where '#' is 1 and '.' is zero, this then becomes '0110'. Since the target is 4 digits long, there's a maximum of 2^4 = 16 possible states we can get to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The buttons can also be represented as binary strings, with (3) mapping to '0010' as this is the bit that it edits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The buttons in bits are then: `['0110', '0101', '0010', '0011', '1010', '1100']`\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now create a graph with 2^4 = 16 nodes and loop over all nodes to create edges between them based on where the buttons take you from a given node.\n",

    "The solution for the example is then the shortest path from zero '0000' = 0 to the target node '0110' = 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeating this for all problems in the input and summing the shortest paths gives the solution."
