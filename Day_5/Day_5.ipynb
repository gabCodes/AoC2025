    "**Note** that you cannot brute force this by creating a set (which removes duplicates) with every entry within the ranges because it ends up being very large. Instead, our approach will:\n",
    "1. Sort the rows so the ranges are in order by column (this works since the upper bound is always bigger than the lower bound)\n",

    "4. If no eating is possible then move up in rows\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate what we mean by eating with an example. Say you have these ranges `10-14, 12-18, 16-20` (note they are sorted) by looking at consecutive rows i and j.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Note** it's important to have the equal signs in case there are duplicate ranges.\n",
